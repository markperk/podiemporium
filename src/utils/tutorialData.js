If the body has a dynamic send object, Podium will send a POST to the url provided in the object and expect back a 'Dynamic Send Response' with a body on it. Attachments work the same way. If there is a dynamic send object on the attachment, an attachment is required on the Dynamic Send Response. A tile expects only one of a body or attachment in the Dynamic Send Response. For every send item with a dynamic_send object, a POST (from Black Mamba) will be sent to the dynamic_send.url, and expects a Dynamic Send Response in return so that it can replace the body, attachment, or tile with whatever body or attachment the third-party sends back.",
